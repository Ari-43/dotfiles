This `/Pictures/wallpapers/dist` directory includes wallpapers I could find the original source for and have asked for permission to distribute, but are not clearly licensed freely.  

Currently this only includes modifications of [Padgriffin's work making](https://imgur.com/a/making-exploded-thinkpad-wallpapers-with-inkscape-gimp-tutorial-i1ASd) the [Thinkpad exploded wallpapers](https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/1aesla8/pads_thinkpad_exploded_wallpapers_requests_thread/), which are based on Lenovo HMM graphics. If you have a Thinkpad of any kind, not just a T480, consider checking out their stuff!
